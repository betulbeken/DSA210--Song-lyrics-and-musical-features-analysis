# Song_lyrics_and_musical_features_analysis
I am Betül Eken, a sophomore Computer Science and Engineering student at Sabancı University.

This is my data science(DSA210) term project about songs, their lyrics and their features like danceability, energy, liveness, valence.


# 🎵 Song Emotion and Feature Analyzer

I'm **Betül Eken**, a freshman Computer Science and Engineering student at **Sabancı University**.

This repository contains my **term project for DSA 210: Introduction to Data Science (Fall 2025–2026)**.

## 🧩 Project Overview

Music is a combination of both sound and language — the audio features of a song define its rhythm and tone, while the lyrics reflect the emotions and stories behind it.  
This project aims to analyze how **musical properties (danceability, energy, valence, etc.)** relate to **lyrics-based characteristics (such as word count and vocabulary richness)**.

By merging two public datasets from Kaggle — one containing audio features and another containing lyrics — I created a combined dataset with around **1,700 songs and over 15 features**.  
The analysis explores statistical and behavioral patterns in songs and attempts to understand how the sound and words of a song interact.

## 🎯 Motivation

Music is a powerful tool for expressing emotions. Some songs feel energetic and happy, while others are calm or melancholic.  
I often notice that the songs I listen to sound "happy" but sometimes have sad lyrics.  
This inspired me to explore the relationship between **what we hear (audio)** and **what we say (lyrics)** — to see if the data reflects these emotional contrasts.

Through this project, I also aim to:
- Apply the techniques learned in DSA210 to a real-world dataset.
- Develop stronger skills in exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing.
- Build a small predictive model that connects lyrical and musical characteristics.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Analyze the relationship between **audio features** (energy, danceability, valence, loudness, etc.) and **lyrics-based statistics**.
2. Apply **EDA, visualization**, and **hypothesis testing** to understand correlations between musical and textual properties.
3. Build a **simple supervised ML model** (e.g., Linear Regression or Decision Tree) to predict musical mood (valence) from lyrics-based features.
4. Practice data cleaning, feature creation, and model evaluation techniques within the DSA210 learning scope.

## ❓ Research Questions

The main questions this project will explore are:

1. Do songs with higher *valence* (positivity in sound) also have longer or simpler lyrics?  
2. Is there a relationship between *energy* and *lyrical complexity*?  
3. Are *acoustic* songs more emotionally diverse in their lyrics than *dance* songs?  
4. Can basic text-based features (like word count or vocabulary richness) help predict a song’s *valence* or *energy* levels?  
5. Which musical features show the strongest correlation with lyrical patterns?
